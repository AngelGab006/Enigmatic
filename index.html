      <h2>What it's this tool</h2>
      <p>
        This tool helps you create a matrix representation of a message, along with the corresponding matrix table. It also provides a way to verify that a given encrypted matrix, when decrypted, returns the original message. This tool is designed to assist students working on cryptography projects.

    <article id="Objetive">
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        The primary objective of this cryptography tool is to assist students in learning and applying matrix-based encryption and decryption techniques through a practical and interactive platform. The tool enables users to create matrix representations of messages, experiment with encryption/decryption, and verify the accuracy of their methods, helping to bridge the gap between theory and practice in cryptography.

      <h2>Ethics</h2>
      <p>
        This cryptography tool is strictly an educational aid for students learning matrix-based encryption techniques. It is not intended for commercial use or to replace the full scope of a student's project work. The tool should be used responsibly to complement the student's own research and problem-solving efforts, not as a substitute. Ethical use of this tool is limited to enhancing the learning experience and supporting the educational objectives of cryptography courses.
